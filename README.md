🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, location, and other relevant factors.

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Building and Training a Linear Regression Model

Model Evaluation & Visualization

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information about houses, including multiple numerical and categorical features.

Dataset is available on kaggle.com

⚙️ Technologies Used
